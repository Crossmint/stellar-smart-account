# Smart Account STRIDE Threat Model

## Description

### What is a Smart Account?

A **Smart Account** is an advanced account implementation built on Stellar's Soroban smart contract platform that provides programmable authorization logic through a custom smart contract. Unlike traditional Stellar accounts that rely solely on Ed25519 signatures and basic multisig thresholds, smart accounts implement Soroban's `CustomAccountInterface` to enable sophisticated, policy-driven authorization rules.

This smart account is an **upgradeable smart contract** that implements both the `SmartAccountInterface` (for account management operations) and Soroban's `CustomAccountInterface` (for transaction authorization). It leverages Stellar's account abstraction framework to decouple authentication logic from application-specific authorization rules, allowing for much more granular control over who can authorize what types of transactions.

The key innovation is moving from Stellar's traditional "signature + threshold" model to a **role-based, policy-driven authorization system** where different signers can have different permission levels and constraints.

### Key Features

#### üîÑ **Fully Authorized Upgradeability**
- Smart contract code can be upgraded through the standard signer permission system
- Upgrades require proper authorization from signers with sufficient permissions
- No special backdoors or admin keys - upgrades follow the same authorization rules as other operations

#### üë• **Hierarchical Signer Types**

| Signer Type | Permissions & Capabilities |
|---|---|
| **Admin Signers** | ‚Ä¢ Can authorize any transaction for the wallet<br>‚Ä¢ Full control over signer configuration (add, update, revoke signers)<br>‚Ä¢ Can authorize contract upgrades<br>‚Ä¢ Cannot be revoked (prevents account lockout) |
| **Standard Signers** | ‚Ä¢ Can authorize most transactions<br>‚Ä¢ Cannot modify signer configuration or upgrade the contract<br>‚Ä¢ Ideal for day-to-day operations while maintaining security boundaries |
| **Restricted Signers** | ‚Ä¢ Subject to a modular, policy-based permission system<br>‚Ä¢ Ideal for security-sensitive scenarios requiring controlled access<br>‚Ä¢ Perfect for delegating permissions to AI agents, automated systems, or third-party services<br>‚Ä¢ Support for granular permissions such as:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Token spending limits<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Contract interaction deny-listing<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Time-based restrictions<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;- Custom authorization policies<br>‚Ä¢ Extensible framework for adding new permission types |

#### üîê **Multi-Signature Algorithm Support**

| Signature Algorithm | Features & Capabilities |
|---|---|
| **Ed25519 Signatures** | ‚Ä¢ Traditional cryptographic signatures<br>‚Ä¢ Backward compatible with existing Stellar tooling |
| **Secp256r1 Signatures** | ‚Ä¢ Enables **Passkey/WebAuthn** authentication flows<br>‚Ä¢ Provides better user experience through biometric authentication<br>‚Ä¢ Supports hardware security keys and platform authenticators<br>‚Ä¢ Eliminates the need for users to manage seed phrases |

This dual signature support allows the smart account to bridge traditional crypto workflows with modern web authentication standards, making it more accessible to mainstream users while maintaining the security guarantees expected in the Stellar ecosystem.


### Smart Account Authentication Flow

#### Simplified Authorization Flow

The Smart Account implements a strict security model with the following core principles:

1. **Universal Authorization Requirement**: Every execution context (transaction operation) MUST be authorized by at least one signer with sufficient permissions
2. **Cryptographic Integrity**: All signatures provided MUST be cryptographically valid and verifiable
3. **Hierarchical Permission Model**: Authorization success depends on the signer's role and the operation being performed

**Step-by-Step Authorization Process:**

1. **Signature Validation Phase**
   - Verify all provided signatures are cryptographically correct (Ed25519 or Secp256r1)
   - Confirm all signing keys exist in the smart account's signer registry
   - Reject the entire transaction if any signature is invalid

2. **Authorization Check Phase**
   - For each execution context in the transaction:
     - Iterate through all verified signers until one with sufficient permissions is found
     - **Admin Signers**: Automatically authorized for all operations
     - **Standard Signers**: Authorized for non-admin operations only
     - **Restricted Signers**: Subject to policy evaluation (spending limits, time restrictions, etc.)
   - **Critical Security Guarantee**: If NO signer with sufficient permissions is found for ANY context, the entire transaction fails

3. **Early Exit Optimization**
   - Authorization stops immediately when the first valid signer is found for each context
   - This prevents unnecessary computation while maintaining security guarantees

**Security Model Summary:**
- **Fail-Safe Default**: Deny all operations unless explicitly authorized
- **No Partial Success**: All contexts must be authorized or the entire transaction fails
- **Cryptographic Foundation**: All authorization decisions are based on verified signatures using Stellar battle-tested cryptographic primitives
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Different signer types have different authorization capabilities

## What can go wrong?

### STRIDE Reminders

| Mnemonic Threat | Definition | Question |
|---|---|---|
| Spoofing | The ability to impersonate another user or system component to gain unauthorized access. | Is the user who they say they are? |
| Tampering | Unauthorized alteration of data or code. | Has the data or code been modified in some way? |
| Repudiation | The ability for a system or user to deny having taken a certain action. | Is there enough data to "prove" the user took the action if they were to deny it? |
| Information Disclosure | The over-sharing of data expected to be kept private. | Is there anywhere where excessive data is being shared or controls are not properly in place to protect private information? |
| Denial of Service | The ability for an attacker to negatively affect the availability of a system. | Can someone, without authorization, impact the availability of the service or business? |
| Elevation of Privilege | The ability for an attacker to gain additional privileges and roles beyond what they initially were granted. | Are there ways for a user, without proper authentication (verifying identity) and authorization (verifying permission) to gain access to additional privileges, either through standard (normally legitimate) or illegitimate means? |
